## Hi there 👋

I'm Andriy, a software developer based in Finland.  
I code in C# (.NET / Unity) and love building things from scratch.

If an idea pops into my head, chances are I'll build it and ship it.  
My main tech stack includes C#, .NET, and Unity. I'm always learning and improving.

I've built 1 project so far, but there are many more coming — the journey is just beginning!

I've got a bunch of pinned projects, but my favorite is the **[Project Name]** (you can add a link if you'd like).

I've built over 100 public repos, but privately, it's probably more than 200 at this point.

If you want to learn how I do what I do, my books and courses are available here! (link if applicable)

Fun Facts:
- I have a cat 🐱
- I don't like coffee or tea ☕
- Demon Slayer is my favorite anime
- Hobbies: anime, gym, building things
